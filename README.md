# Competitive
###Simple repo for my competitive programming course.

All assignments are in `/Assignments/src/` just so it works nicely with Eclipse.

Find the Bug problems written by my instructor, corrected by myself. Everything else written by yours truly.

Assignments from [here](https://github.com/gpdowning/cs104c).
